## How-is-a-Transaction-Verified-on-a-Cryptocurrency-Network 2025

Cryptocurrency transactions are digitally signed using cryptography, then confirmed by the network. Then transactions are added to the blockchain through.

Crypto transactions are decentralized and don‚Äôt rely on banks or intermediaries. They are irreversible, so once confirmed, they cannot be canceled or disputed like credit card payments. They use blockchain technology for transparency and security, allowing anyone to verify transactions without exposing personal information.

But how exactly are these transactions verified to ensure they are secure and legitimate? This process is crucial for maintaining trust in the system and preventing fraud. 

 In this article, we‚Äôll explore the step-by-step process of transaction verification on a cryptocurrency network, explain the different consensus mechanisms, and discuss the security features that keep your digital assets safe. Whether you‚Äôre using a Tangem cold crypto wallet or any other wallet, understanding how transactions are verified is key to navigating the world of cryptocurrency.

## Step-by-Step Process of Transaction Verification
Let‚Äôs go 

## Transaction creation
The process begins when a user initiates a transaction. This could be sending cryptocurrency to another person, swapping tokens, or even staking coins. The user specifies the amount, the recipient‚Äôs address, and any additional data required by the network, such as destination tag or memo.

## 1. Transaction Signing
The transaction data (amount, recipient address, fees, etc.) is formatted according to the blockchain‚Äôs rules. Then a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256 for Bitcoin) generates a unique transaction hash.

The sender‚Äôs private key is used to sign the transaction hash using an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm (e.g., ECDSA for Bitcoin, EdDSA for Solana). This creates a digital signature, which proves ownership and authorizes the transaction. The digital signature is now attached to the transaction and ready for broadcast to the network for validation and confirmation.

## 2. Broadcasting to the Network
After the transaction is signed, it is broadcast to the cryptocurrency network. This means the transaction is sent to all the nodes (computers) in the network. Nodes are responsible for verifying and relaying transactions to ensure they reach all participants in the network. This step is crucial for maintaining the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.

## 3. Transaction Validation
Once the transaction reaches the nodes, it undergoes a validation process. The nodes check several things:

Sender‚Äôs Balance: They ensure the sender has enough cryptocurrency to complete the transaction.
Digital Signature: They verify the digital signature to confirm the transaction was authorized by the sender.
Transaction Format: They check if the transaction adheres to the network‚Äôs rules and protocols.
If the transaction passes these checks, it is considered valid and moves to the next stage.

## 4. Adding to the Mempool
Valid transactions are then added to a pool of pending transactions known as the mempool. The mempool acts as a waiting area where transactions sit until they are picked up by miners or validators for inclusion in a block. Transactions in the mempool are often prioritized based on factors like transaction fees, with higher fees increasing the chances of being processed faster.

## 5. Consensus Mechanism Involvement
This is where the consensus mechanism comes into play. Different blockchains use different methods to agree on the validity of transactions and add them to the blockchain. The two most common consensus mechanisms are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Proof of Work (PoW): Used by Bitcoin, PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency.
Proof of Stake (PoS): Used by Ethereum and other blockchains, PoS selects validators based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to ‚Äústake‚Äù as collateral. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on their stake, reducing the need for energy-intensive computations.

## 6. Block Confirmation
Once a miner or validator successfully creates a block, the transactions within that block are considered confirmed. The block is then added to the blockchain, and the transaction is finalized. However, for added security, most networks require multiple confirmations (i.e., additional blocks added on top of the one containing the transaction) before considering the transaction fully settled.

## 7. Finalizing the Transaction
After the block is added to the blockchain, it is propagated across the network, ensuring all nodes have an updated copy of the ledger. The transaction is now complete, and the recipient can see the funds in their wallet. This entire process, from creation to finalization, typically takes a few minutes to an hour, depending on the network and the consensus mechanism used.
